<p>Xueqiang (Brandon) Wang is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at <a href="https://www.ucf.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UCF</a>, where he is also a member of the Cyber Security and Privacy Cluster (<a href="https://cyber.cs.ucf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CyberSP</a>). Dr. Wang obtained his Ph.D. in 2021 from Indiana University Bloomington and worked in security and privacy R&D teams at Symantec Research Labs, NIO USA, and Amazon Lab126. Prior to that, he earned a Master’s degree from IIE CAS receiving a Dean’s Award in 2015 and a Bachelor’s degree from USTC in 2012.</p>

<p> Dr. Wang leads the Security and PRIvacy for smarT systems (<b>SPIRIT</b>) lab at UCF. His recent research focuses on the <b>privacy compliance and security of software systems and devices</b>, ranging from existing mobile and IoT applications to emerging AI-enabled software and devices. His earlier studies concentrated on technically analyzing privacy and security issues, but more recently, driven by the goal of empowering both developers and users, he has focused on developing developer-centered solutions to mitigate these issues, understanding their impact on end users, and educating users to prevent further harm. Besides, he remains interested in understanding various cybercrime activities. </p>
