Before that, he earned a Master's degree from <a href="http://www.iie.cas.cn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IIE, CAS</a> in 2015, and a Bachelor's degree from <a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USTC</a> in 2012. He is currently a Security Engineer at Amazon Lab126, designing solutions to scale security/privacy analysis on Amazon devices (2020-Now). He also worked at Symantec Research Labs (now <a href="https://www.nortonlifelock.com/us/en/research-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NortonLifeLock Research Group</a>, 2018) and NIO USA on security issues of smart home devices and smart vehicles.</p>

<p>His research focuses on revealing **cybercriminal activities** with scalable and data-driven approaches, identifying **security vulnerabilities** with intelligent security analysis, and designing **new attacks** (and mitigations) to enhance the security of mobile and Internet-of-Things systems, etc. He has published 12 papers on leading security venues such as S&P (Oakland), USENIX Security, CCS, NDSS and TDSC, and is one of the inventors of 2 U.S. patents. His research was recognized by some academic awards, e.g., two papers are among the top-10 finalists of CSAW Best Applied Security Paper Award. He also received acknowledgments and rewards from top tech companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, etc. for discoveries of new attacks and security vulnerabilities in their products.</p>
