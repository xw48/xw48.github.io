<p>In Fall 2022, Dr. Xueqiang Wang will join the Department of Computer Science, and the Cyber Security and Privacy Cluster (<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ucfcybersp/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CyberSP</a>) as an Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://www.ucf.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Central Florida</a>. He earned a Ph.D. degree from Indiana University Bloomington in 2021, a Master’s degree from IIE CAS in 2015, and a Bachelor’s degree from USTC in 2012. He also has experience working as a Security Engineer/Researcher at Amazon Lab126, Symantec Research labs, and NIO USA.</p>

<p>His research focuses on identifying <b>security vulnerabilities</b> with intelligent security analysis, measuring <b>cybercriminal activities</b> with data-driven approaches, and discovering new <b>attacks and mitigations</b>, to enhance the security of mobile, IoT, and cloud systems. He has published 10+ papers on leading security venues such as S&P (Oakland), USENIX Security, CCS, NDSS, and TDSC, and is an inventor of 2 U.S. patents. His research was well recognized by academia (with two papers among the top-10 finalist of CSAW Best Applied Security Paper Award), and received acknowledgements and rewards from top tech companies such as Google,  Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, etc. for the discoveries of attacks/vulnerabilities in real-world systems. </p>
