He is also a faculty member of the Cyber Security and Privacy Cluster (<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ucfcybersp/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CyberSP</a>). He earned a Ph.D. degree from Indiana University Bloomington in 2021 (under the supervision of Dr. XiaoFeng Wang), a Master’s degree from IIE CAS in 2015, and a Bachelor’s degree from USTC in 2012. He also has experience working as a Security Engineer/Researcher at Amazon Lab126, Symantec Research labs, and NIO USA.</p>

<p>His main research interest involves identifying security vulnerabilities, measuring cybercriminal activities, discovering new attack surfaces, and designing security mitigations in the broad fields of mobile, IoT, and software supply chain, using program analysis and data-driven approaches (ML, NLP, etc.). He has published 10+ papers on leading security venues such as S&P (Oakland), USENIX Security, CCS, NDSS, and TDSC, and is an inventor of 2 U.S. patents. His research was well recognized by academia (with two papers among the finalists of CSAW Best Applied Security Paper Award), and received acknowledgements and rewards from top tech companies such as Google,  Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, etc. for the discoveries of attacks/vulnerabilities in real-world systems.</p>
