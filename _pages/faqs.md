<br><b>Application Requirements?</b>: All applicants need to meet the <a href="https://www.cs.ucf.edu/graduate/graduate-admissions/">UCF graduate admissions requirements</a>. Please don’t contact me if you fail to meet any of them, as I cannot make a waiver of any kind.</p>
  
<b>Funding?</b>: All Ph.D. students will have support for tuition fees, health insurance, and stipends that cover their living expenses. I don’t support short-term visitors, and visiting scholars without a Ph.D. degree, unless I know them well through prior collaborations or they are referred by someone I know well. 
  
<b>Is security background required?</b>: The short answer is NO. Although I do appreciate research experience in security, it is not a requirement for joining our team. I am looking for students with diverse backgrounds (e.g., in NLP, ML, Hardware, etc.), so that we can explore interesting security problems in a broader domain.
  
<b>Is GRE/TOEFL required?</b>: YES for international students. Please see <a href="https://www.cs.ucf.edu/graduate/graduate-admissions/">UCF graduate admissions requirements</a> for more information.

<b>How long is the PhD program?</b> This depends on the research topic, how motivated you are, and many other factors that affect your study. Ph.D. is a challenging, enjoyable, and long journey. I see students take 4-8 years.
